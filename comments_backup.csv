They absolutely love the death penalty and are disgusted by the homeless who die on the streets and they have had so many chances to change our minds, to show us that they are pro life. But they don‚Äôt because they don‚Äôt care.  I‚Äôm truly embarrassed i believed them for so long. I thought, these Christian nationalists are fringe and no one will support them, it won‚Äôt last. I thought well they are my in laws so I‚Äôll listen and believe they are good and they see this affects me and they tell me about all this mercy of Jesus. And they are all delusional about what the majority of the country wants and needs. They shamed my Norwegian family all the time, they are not religious, well educated, my mom has her own last name and I never bought into that, but I at least respected that they just don‚Äôt know any better, they are loving, or they want to be.

It's been sold to refugees & international students as a land justripewith opportunities. When in actuality, we are nearly a decade into a housing crisis, wages are stagnant, and tensions in every which way aretight.We are a country that is (generally) very angry & frustrated with one another, similarly to the US. And now shelters in Toronto & major cities across the country are maxed out, and this summer has been record hot but it'sCanada...I am honestly terrified for what awaits us come the winter. Our governments need to do some real deep bipartisan shit & figure out where, & how, to shelter these humans. Quickly.;This is my fear as well. There are similar problems up here in Canada.

Our housing situtation is just craptastic for anyone wanting to move here.  +1M$ houses is just unattanable to anyone.;Oh yeah I know what you mean, I live within the  GTA area and know exactly how the weather is in Toronto, we may have the nice lake effect but there will be those day and nights that are just brutal, absolutely brutal.I can't imagine how it is in other parts of Canada but I was talking to someone recently about our weather, Toronto's been pretty mildly cool than hot like last year.Our government needs to slow down immigration and figure it out first before accepting so many all at once.
